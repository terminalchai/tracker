# Tracker — Agent Reference

Tracker is a pipeline orchestration engine for multi-agent LLM workflows.
Pipelines are defined in `.dip` files (the Dippin language) and executed
with parallel agents via a TUI dashboard. Built by 2389.ai.

## Conventions used in these docs

- Code blocks fenced with a language tag (`bash`, `dip`) carry the runnable
  commands or pipeline snippets being described in the surrounding prose.
- `.dip` files use the Dippin pipeline language — see the Workflows and
  Architecture pages for the IR-to-Tracker mapping rules.
- Provider names follow tracker convention: `anthropic`, `openai`, `gemini`
  (not `google`). Base URL resolution goes through
  `tracker.ResolveProviderBaseURL(provider)`.
